# Use Nginx Containers to deploy Micro Frontends

## Context

To deploy Microfrontends we need a possible solution.

## Decision

The decision is to deploy an Nginx Container with the Javascript Code, per Frontend.
This will provide. easy and fast deployments.

## Consequences

There needs to be a build process that takes care of it.
Also the Frontend needs to be able to work with different versions of the backend,
using semantic versioning.

## Possible Alternatives

A possible alternative would be, to bundle the javascript code as part of the Backend Services.
But this would couple the deployment of backend and frontends, with all positive and negative consequences.
